# MVC-Contact-Book-Application
Contact Book helps us to manage Contacts &amp; lists Upcoming Birthdays.

"Contact Book Application" is a J2EE based project which just uses Raw MVC, Servlet, JSP & JDBC. No framework is used.

I have used Best Practice Design Patternsâ€‹such as MVC, Intercepting Filter, Listener, Front Controller, DTO, DAO Factory and Helper Class Design Pattern.

This achieves the Structure of any Web Application.

Connection Pooling, Sending Email & Confirmation of Email has been implemented as delta functionality.

Code is packed in .war file. HSQLDB is used for Data Storage. Ofcourse, you can use any data storage & DAO Factory design pattern will help you for achieving this.

Thank you.
